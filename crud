Create, read, update and delete (CRUD)

In computer programming, create, read, update and delete[1]
as an acronym CRUD or possibly a backronym)
(Sometimes called SCRUD with an "S" for Search) are the four basic functions of
persistent storage.[2] Sometimes CRUD is expanded with the words retrieve instead
of read, modify instead of update, or destroy instead of delete.
It is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that
facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information; often using
computer-based forms and reports. The term was likely first popularized
by James Martin in his 1983 book Managing the Data-base Environment.[1][3]
The acronym may be extended to CRUDL to cover listing of large data sets
which bring additional complexity such as pagination when the data sets are
too large to hold easily in memory.

Another variation of CRUD is BREAD, an acronym for "Browse, Read, Edit, Add,
Delete".[citation needed] This extension is mostly used in context with data
protection concepts, when it is legally not allowed to delete data directly.
Locking the data prevents the access for users without destroying still needed
data. Yet another variation, used before CRUD became more common, is MADS,
an acronym for "Modify, All, Delete, Show."[citation needed]

for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS),
or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).
